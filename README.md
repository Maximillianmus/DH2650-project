# DH2650

**Set Features:**

- Style: Low poly, make our own models?
- Core mechanic: Grappling Hook/Harpoon
- Having nautical chart / map of an ocean as a level select hub

## Alternative 1) Focus on Combat

- Perhaps procedurally generated levels
- Can feature simple puzzles
- Seamap has ports, gives player ability to buy/sell
- Players find loot (money, relics that strengthens their character, harpoon/grappeling hook improvements)

	**Combat mechanics:**

	- Grab enemies with hook
	- “Fly” to enemies with hook
	- Could offer player harpoon tweaks/enhancements
		- reset cooldown on kill
		- Greater speed/length
		- Move through certain walls?

## Alternative 2) Focus on Puzzles

- We design a set of levels

	**Puzzle idea:**
	
	- Treasure hunt
	- Solve riddles
	- Pull lever from distance
	- Pull objects to you
	- Harpoon can drag you through certain walls?


**Additional Ideas**

- Swim underwater
- Player can unlock another harpoon/grappling hook
- To get to a location on the seamap you may have to cross an unkown event, can be nothing, a storm or perhaps the KRAKEN
- Player can have some resource (ex. mana) that they can use for special abilities. Empowered harpoon, stealth, etc
- Some enemies can have some shield, shields them from a direct hit of the harpoon?
- Some enemies can fly. The player can then hook themselves to "fly" around. Could be a fun thing.
